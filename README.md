Google Chrome 44.0.2403.157 for Windows 64-bit

This version is the final version of Google Chrome with NPAPI.

To download, click "44.0.2403.157_chrome64_installer.exe", and click "Raw".

First uninstall Chrome if you have 45 or later. Opening the file while 45 or later is installed will simply open Chrome.

Note that if in Settings > On startup, you selected "Continue where you left off", restarting with Chrome 44 may cause all tabs to be unresponsive. You might think Chrome is broken, but it is not. Newly created tabs will function normally. Simply go to the unresponsive tab, copy the current URL, and open a new tab with that URL.
